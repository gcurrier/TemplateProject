# TemplateProject

This project is my attempt at building a kind of "starter pack" for a semi-specific type of javascript project using node.

## Progress
* 2018-03-25: 
> Incorporated webpack, webpack-dev-server and type script successfully (along with a rudimentary application that can be used for 
> testing. Also included is a means to lazy load designated modules, as well as incorporate required file assets (css, less, sass, xml,csv 
> files) and build the template "index.html" page during the build process.

## Next Steps
- [ ] include React, React-Dom, Babel
- [ ] include React-Router
- [ ] Incorporate a testing framework (such as Chai or Mocha)
